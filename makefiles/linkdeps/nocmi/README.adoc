= ldeps nocmi

Demonstrates that the link action depgraph needs only cmx files, not cmi files.

The job of the cmi file is done once it no longer needs to play a role
in module compilation. Once the modules are compiled, they contain
info about the cmx files they need, but no longer need their cmi files.

So when it comes time to link compiled modules into an executable, we
only need the cmx files. No need for sigfiles, because all references
have been resolved during compilation.

Compare C/C++, where headers are only needed for compilation, not
linking.
