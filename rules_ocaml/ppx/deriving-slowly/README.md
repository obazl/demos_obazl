## deriving slowly examples

These examples are taken directly from https://github.com/rgrinberg/deriving-slowly.  They're here to demonstrate what's involved in building simple PPXs.

The original blog post, very good especially for those new to PPXes: [Deriving Slowly](http://rgrinberg.com/posts/deriving-slowly/).

WARNING:  They don't seem to work with 4.13.0
