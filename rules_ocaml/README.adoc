= rules_ocaml demos

== Getting started

=== Using a local switch

First  `cd rules_ocaml`, then:

0. `$ opam update`

1. `$ opam switch import .obazl.d/opam/local.manifest --switch .`

2. `$ bazel run @opam//coswitch/local:refresh`

3. `$ bazel test test`

WARNING: Steps 1 & 2 may take a while. OPAM will download and compile the
entire OCaml toolsuite, then use it to compile all the packages listed
in `.obazl.d/opam/local.manifest`.

If you get errors involving missing "@something..." it probably means
your local switch/coswitch is misconfigured. Try rerunning

`$ bazel run @opam//local:refresh`.


== OPAM deps

* findlib
* ounit2
* ppxlib
* lwt (only for mwe/hello_lwt)
