= udr: user-defined resolver

In some cases, the user may wish to define a namespace whose name
matches the name one of the submodules in the ns. For example a
'color' namespace might contain a Color submodule, as well as Red,
Green, and Blue modules. The fields in the Color module should be
accessible as Color.foo, etc., and the other submodules should be
accessible via qualified names, just as if the resolver had been
generated, e.g. Color.Red.

In this latter case, the ocaml_ns rule will generate a
resolver module containing aliases for all submodules except the
matching one. The name will be the ns name with two trailing
underscores; e.g. *Color__.ml*.

not implemented:

The user can provide a custom resolver module by passing it in the
`resolver` attribute. The resolver module name will determine the
namespace name.

In that case no resolver will be generated by ocaml_ns.
