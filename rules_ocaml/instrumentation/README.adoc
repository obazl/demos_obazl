= Instrumentation

WARNING: The Dune documentation often refers to “backends”. What that
seems to mean is “instrumentation library”. There is no back/front
dichotomy involved, so OBazl does not “backend” terminology.

An instrumentation library, in practice, is a ppx that injects
instrumentation code that will emit some data at runtime. So
instrumenting your code simply means running it through a ppx
transformation. (It may also require that you add some ppx code to
your sources.)

IOW, an instrumentation library adds some side-effects to your library.
