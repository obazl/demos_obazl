# Configuration

Demonstrates use of Starlark (a/k/a user-defined) "build settings".

See [User-defined build settings](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html#user-defined-build-settings)

We use some flags predefined by Skylib, a starlark library; see
[Common build setting rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/master/rules/common_settings.bzl)
