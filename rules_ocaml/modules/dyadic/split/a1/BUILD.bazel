# Demostrates a module composed of a structfile and a sigfile in
# different directories.

# To build the sig:    $ bazel build module_binding/dyadic/split/a1/sig:Hello
# To build the module: $ bazel build module_binding/dyadic/split/a1:Hello
# To run the test:     $ bazel test module_binding/dyadic/split/a1:test

# Note that the targets in sig/ and struct/ have visibility attributes
# that expose them where they are used; without these, visibility
# defaults to private so the build would fail.

# To examine the build actions, just replace "build" and "test" in the
# above commands with "aquery. In the output, notice the symlink
# actions: they show that the source files are linked into a working
# directory, which is where the compilation occurs. This ensures that
# everything will be where the compiler expects it - in particular,
# that the sigfile is in the same directory as the structfile. If it's
# not, the compiler will give up and extract the signature from the
# structfile, effectively ignoring the separate .mli file when it
# compiles the .ml file.

# The general rule of the standard compilers that this demonstrates is
# what we might call "signature locality": to compile a .ml file, the
# compile will first search for the corresponding .mli file *in the
# same directory*. If it finds it, it will then look for the .cmi file
# and use that in compiling the .ml file. If it does not find it, it
# will look no further; instead it will extract the .mli file from the
# .ml file, compile it, and use it for compiling the .ml file.

# Thus in order to support splitting of modules into sig and struct
# files in different directories, the build system must step in and do
# what the compile cannot do, namely ensure that both files are in the
# same (working) directory before compilation proceeds.
